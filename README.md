[00:02.80] They're rotting my brain, love
[00:05.75] These hoes are the same
[00:17.25] 
[00:11.31] I admit it, another hoe got me finished
[00:14.47] Broke my heart, oh no, you didn't
[00:17.61] Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
[00:20.56] Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
[00:23.28] Need a bartender, put me out of my sorrow
[00:26.59] Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
[00:29.07] With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
[00:32.10] And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
[00:55.10] 
[00:35.03] Who am I kiddin'?
[00:36.51] All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
[00:39.51] I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
[00:42.38] I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
[00:45.20] Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
[00:49.45] Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
[00:52.35] Feel like I be runnin' a race, I'm not winnin'
[00:55.45] Ran into the devil today, and she grinnin'
[01:16.45] 
[01:04.65] Hey, these girls are insane
[01:10.88] All girls are the same
[01:13.93] They're rotting my brain, love
[01:16.82] Think I need a change
[01:19.83] Before I go insane, love
[01:22.78] All girls are the same
[01:25.73] They're rotting my brain, love
[01:28.60] Think I need a change
[01:31.42] Before I go insane, love
[01:43.42] 
[01:34.33] Ten minutes, she tell me it would take ten minutes
[01:37.38] To break my heart, oh no, she didn't
[01:40.57] Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
[01:43.35] Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow
[01:46.29] And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
[01:48.93] I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
[01:52.07] All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
[01:55.16] It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'
[02:20.16] 
[02:10.35] Now I am insane
[02:13.13] Demons in my brain, love
[02:16.16] Peace I can't obtain
[02:19.04] 'Cause all these girls the same, love
[02:22.11] Now I am insane
[02:25.06] Demons in my brain, love
[02:27.98] Peace I can't obtain
[02:30.62] 'Cause all these girls the same, love
